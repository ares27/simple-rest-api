# simple-rest-api

I was testing a webapp one day and I had to call a JSON endpoint. I automatically navigated to [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), but on this day the creators were updating the service. I wrote this API in the event that I come across downtime again.

Maybe it could be an API for you to quickly test too.
